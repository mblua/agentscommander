// Per-workgroup busy→all-idle transition detector for Feature #110.
//
// **Spec deviation:** issue #110 calls for per-*team* aggregation, but
// `sessionsStore.state.teams` is currently dead code — `setTeams()` is
// defined but never called from anywhere in the repo. We aggregate by
// workgroup instead, sourcing from `projectStore.projects[].workgroups[]`
// (the live data path that ProjectPanel/TeamFilter actually use).
// **If teams become live (someone wires up `setTeams`), revisit this
// aggregation** — the right unit may be the team-config rather than the
// workgroup instance.
//
// **Why per-session previous-busy tracking** (instead of a busy *set*
// diff): "session destroyed", "session exited", and "session renamed"
// all collapse to "session left the aggregation" under a set-diff
// model, which would fire spurious beeps on user kills, exit-0
// processes, and rename events. Tracking each session's busy flag from
// the previous tick lets us require a *genuine* busy→idle flip on a
// still-alive bound session before we consider beeping.
//
// **Why a stable sessionId→wgPath binding**: sessions match replicas
// by name `${wg.name}/${replica.name}` at creation, but can be renamed
// later. Resolving the binding on every effect run by name means a
// busy session whose name changes drops out of its workgroup's
// aggregation, which is exactly the bug above. We bind once on first
// observation and never unbind, so rename-while-busy is harmless.
//
// **Why createRoot**: the watcher is started from inside an async
// onMount in SidebarApp; by the time we reach `await
// settingsStore.load()` the synchronous reactive owner is gone.
// createRoot gives the effect its own owner and an explicit dispose
// we can call from onCleanup.
//
// **Focused-WG suppression (#254)**: while the user is looking at a
// workgroup (the active session belongs to it AND the AC window holds
// OS focus), that workgroup's beep is gated off — they can already
// see the state change, the beep is redundant. When focus moves away
// (tab switch or alt-tab), the just-left workgroup keeps suppressing
// for GRACE_MS to absorb the user's typical short detour back.
